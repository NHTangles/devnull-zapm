# devnull-zapm
ZAPM roguelike with patches for devnull tournament.
ZAPM is a sci-fi themed roguelike by Cyrus Dolph. 
Official version here: http://www.zapm.org

The /dev/null/nethack tournament features ZAPM as one of the "challlenges"
that may be encountered by players.  This repository will track, as far as
is practical, the official version, with only the changes required for
integration into the devnull tournamenet.
