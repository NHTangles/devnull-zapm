bomb
    Pinback: But you can't explode in the bomb bay because it's
    foolish!  You'll kill us all!  There's no reason for it!

    Bomb #20: I am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes.  Detonation
    will occur at the programmed time.

    Pinback: Wouldn't you consider another course of action, for
    example just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?

    Bomb #20: No.

brain bug
     "Insects with intelligence?!!  Have you ever met one?  I can't
     believe I am hearing this nonsense.  This is the most ridiculous
     conversation I have ever..."

     "Would you just wait a minute!!  (expletive deleted) Maybe there is
     some kind of bug that we haven't seen yet, a leadership caste, a hive
     brain..."

     "Brain bug?!!!  Frankly I find the idea of a bug that thinks
     offensive!"

brain cylinder
     There was a harmless way to extract a brain, and a way to keep
     the organic residue alive during its absence. The bare, compact
     cerebral matter was then immersed in an occasionally replenished
     fluid within an ether-tight cylinder of a metal mined in Yuggoth,
     certain electrodes reaching through and connecting at will with
     elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the three vital
     faculties of sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus-
     beings to carry the brain-cylinders intact through space was an
     easy matter. Then, on every planet covered by their civilisation,
     they would find plenty of adjustable faculty-instruments capable
     of being connected with the encased brains; so that after a
     little fitting these travelling intelligences could be given a
     full sensory and articulate life - albeit a bodiless and
     mechanical one - at each stage of their journeying through and
     beyond the space-time continuum. It was as simple as carrying a
     phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of
     corresponding make exists. Of its success there could be no
     question. Akeley was not afraid. Had it not been brilliantly
     accomplished again and again?

energy dome
     It was designed according to ancient ziggaurat mound proportions
     used in votive worship. Like the mounds it collects energy and
     recirculates it.  In this case the Dome collects energy that
     escapes from the crown of the human head and pushes it back into
     the Medula Oblongata for increased mental energy. It's very
     important that you buy a cheap plastic hardhat liner, adjust it
     to your head size and affix it with duct tape or Super Glue to
     the inside of the Dome. This allows the Dome to "float" just
     above the cranium and thus do it's job.  Unfortunately, sans hard
     hat liner, the recirculation of energy WILL NOT occur.

     Scattered around the base are drums containing fuel, toxic waste,

     off a barrel, but a single blast of any of the other weapons
     usually does the trick.

     The Greys are an race of Aliens called the Zarflakoneons.  They
     live right by the Xeroxomites.  Of course the Xeroxomites are are
     really a race of alien that were created by the Hondacordoneans.
     The Hondacordoneans are in an intergalactic war with the
     Toyotanites who need the Toyotanites toenail clippings to power
     thier fuel cells.  Proof?  You want proof?  Well, I'm sorry
     that's impossible.  You see our Hubble Telescope just can't see
     that far out into space.  But don't worry, in 2012 all 4 alien
     races are gonna come here to collect on a Roth IRA they jointly
     opened back in the 40's.  It's be worth billions. We'll get to
     meet them all then.

mi-go
     What people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like
     any they had ever seen before. Naturally, there were many human
     bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic period; but
     those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that
     they were not human, despite some superficial resemblances in
     size and general outline. Nor, said the witnesses, could they
     have been any kind of animal known to Vermont. They were pinkish
     things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast
     pairs of dorsal fins or membranous wings and several sets of
     articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid,
     covered with multitudes of very short antennae, where a head
     would ordinarily be.

     Well don't look at me, it's the tribbles who are breeding.  if we
     don't get them off this ship we're gonna end up knee deep in
     them...  The nearest thing I can figure out is that they're born
     pregnant.  Which seems to be quite a timesaver...  And from my
     observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will.
     And brother have they got a lot of will.
